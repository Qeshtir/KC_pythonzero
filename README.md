# KC_pythonzero
Here is a bunch of my personal best solutions for KC tasks.

Files named "10_xxx" contains several implementations of Navigator task of these free course https://karpov.courses/pythonzero
Unit 10, task 1.
Original file (10_finalCall) is approx 10 times slower, then optimized (10_finalCallOptimized). Random cell selection is used in original version. Heuristic is used in optimized version.
10_step_test is a set of KC tests for this step just to debug optimized version.

File linear_02 in LA_KC dir is an example of SVD matrix transformation function and it's comparison with original numpy function.
Original task is taken from https://karpov.courses/mathsds Unit 4, step 16.

Somewhere you can find comments in russian language. This is a consequence of mine mindset - when task is really complicated, I can write comments only in english. Afterward, I've added some comments to structurise result. 

It can be recreated via PyCharm or JupiterNotebook with pandas package installed.
